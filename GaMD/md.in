!!! INPUT
 irest = 1      ! restarting simulation 
 ntx = 5        ! read in coordinates and velocities

!!! OUTPUT
 ntxo = 2       ! restart file format binary
 ntpr = 50   ! write energy information every 100000 steps to log file
 ntwx = 50   ! write coordinates every 100000 steps to a trajectory file
 ntwr = 50   ! write restart file every 100000 steps to corresponding file
 ioutfm = 1     ! use binary NetCDF format for trajectories

!!! DYNAMICS
 nstlim = 150000000 ! perform that many MD steps
 dt = 0.002     ! use time steps of 2fs

!!! TEMPERATURE
 ntt = 3        ! constant temperature, Langevin dynamics
 tempi = 300    ! initial temperature T = 275 K
 temp0 = 300    ! reference temperature T = 275 K
 gamma_ln = 1   ! collision frequency = 5/ps
 ig = -1        ! Langevin thermostat random force

!!! CONSTRAINTS
 ntc = 2        ! bonds with hydrogens

!!! POTENTIAL ENERGY EVALUATION
 ntf = 2        ! ignore bonded interactions with hydrogens (ntc != 1)
 cut = 9999.0   ! effectively no truncation of nonbonded pairs (actually default with implicit solvent)
 rgbmax = 9999.0 ! effectively no truncation betweem atom pairs for Born-radius

!!! IMPLICIT SOLVENT
 igb = 5        ! HCT GB model
